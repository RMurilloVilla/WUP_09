```{r include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
require(tigerstats)
require(tidyverse)
Fish = read.csv("Fish.csv")
Perch = filter(Fish, Species == "Perch")
Pike = filter(Fish, Species == "Pike")
Roach = filter(Fish, Species == "Roach")
```

# Predicting Fish Weight

From this graph I see that best two predictions of wt for perch are Lenght and Height. 

## Perch
```{r}
pwt = lm(Weight~ Length1+ Length2, data= Perch)
summary(pwt)
```

```{r}

```


### Best Models
Best model for this case is using all 4 models. 

### Best Two regressor model

From the graph the best two-parameter regressor model is based 
## Pike
